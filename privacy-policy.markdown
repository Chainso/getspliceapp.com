# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 25, 2025**

Splice ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the Splice mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Account Information:** When you sign up, we may collect your name, email address, and profile picture.
- **Receipt Data:** When you use our AI-powered scanner, we process the images of receipts you upload to extract line items, prices, and tax information.

### App Permissions
To provide our services, Splice requires access to certain features on your device:
- **Camera:** To take photos of receipts for processing.
- **Photo Library:** To upload existing receipt images.
- **Contacts:** To help you find and split expenses with friends and family.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Provide, maintain, and improve the Splice app.
- Process and analyze receipts using AI and OCR technology.
- Synchronize your expenses across devices in real-time.
- Facilitate group expense sharing and tracking.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal data. We may share information:
- **With Other Users:** When you join a group or split an expense, your name and the shared expense data will be visible to other members of that group.
- **With Service Providers:** We use third-party services like Supabase for backend infrastructure and AI providers for OCR processing. These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their tasks.

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. We use secure backend services and encryption where appropriate.
